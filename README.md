📚 The N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens challenge involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard without any two threatening each other. That means:
- No two queens in the same row, column, or diagonal
This project demonstrates how recursive backtracking solves the problem by trying, validating, and backtracking moves to find all valid arrangements.
