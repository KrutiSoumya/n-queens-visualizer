# ♛ N-Queens Visualiser

An interactive visualisation of the N-Queens problem using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps you understand how the backtracking algorithm works by animating queen placements on a chessboard.

## 📚 About the N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is the challenge of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means:
- No two queens share the same row
- No two queens share the same column
- No two queens share the same diagonal

This visualiser uses **recursive backtracking** to explore all possible configurations.
